# Sprint x Report (2/2/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
   * Add more videos
   * Clean up home page
   * Solve various bugs that exist
   * Planning new features

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The main work we've done for this sprint is to make our app work better than it already does. For example, solve some small bugs, ensure the smoothness of the application, and try to add new GPS and map functions. Because we want to implement dual platforms, we must ensure that the existing code does not have serious bugs before it can be transplanted from the Android platform to the new IOS platform. Customers agree and support these ideas and processes. We have added this discussion to our future work list for the final purpose of the product.

## Unfinished Work
Features we are still finishing and refining:
* Movable map with location
* Allow users to select their current location and only serve them videos from specific destinations
* Implement 2FA for user login
* Added bus routes

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuroar-vrapps/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed
 We cleaned up the homepage and other various bugs.
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 
 * We need to be able to embed video into the application without making the application take up too much memory. (At present, we have tried our best to reduce the memory usage, but there is still room for improvement)
 * We still need to implement a functional map page for our application.
