# Project Name
CougDirect (WSU ROAR- VR APPLICATION)
## Project summary
WSU ROAR is a program at WSU for students with mental disabilities. Our project is run through this program, and we intend to design a mobile application for
these students to help them navigate the WSU campus. We plan to help them by letting them indicate which WSU buildings, and other locations they would like to go to, 
and then it will help them with directions, as well as first person videos and 360 tours of each building. The user will be able to make a path of multiple locations on campus
that will help them find their way. 
### One-sentence description of the project
Mobile Application with VR capabilities to help students navigate their way around the WSU campus. 

### Additional information about the project
The user will include a video series of walking tours of campus, as well as VR capable tours of indoor locations on campus.
TODO: Write a compelling/creative/informative project description / summary

## Installation
The application will be available for download on both iOS and Android. 
### Prerequisites
The user just must have a phone capable of running iOS or Android operating system. For the VR capabilities, the user must use an Oculus headset. (WSU ROAR
HAS THESE HEADSETS AT THEIR LOCATION FOR STUDENTS TO USE)
TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which versions of Ruby/Rails)

### Add-ons
The add ons so far are just the VR capable videos, these can help the user see a full perspective on the inside of each wsu location. 
TODO: List which add-ons are included in the project, and the purpose each add-on serves in your app.

### Installation Steps
There will be a download link at first, but plan to put on the Apple app store, and Google Play store for free to allow students to download. 
TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you mention `bundle install`).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. 


## Functionality
The functionality will be made as simple as possible for the user. The user should be able to just click the buttons with clear messages and be able to navigate
the app as easily as possible. 
TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section,
and showcase your features.
