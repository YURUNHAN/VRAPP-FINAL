# Sprint x Report (11/9/22)

## What's New (User Facing)
* Application demo pages created
* Homepage has been set up (No functional buttons as of this momemnt)
* List of locations page has been set up (has functional buttons that send user to desired location page)
* Location Page has been set up (No functional buttons as of this momemnt)

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We decided to use Flutter for our implementation of our application. This option will allow us to publish an 
application that would be compatible for both IOS and Android platforms. This resulted in us having to swap over
to Dart instead of using Swift which is not a problem at all. So far, we have set up our main application demo 
pages (Homepage, List of locations page, and the destination/location page). The only page that has fully functioning
buttons is the List of Destination Page, however we plan on completing the other listed pages ASAP. Communication between
team members and our client has not been a problem at all, so getting feedback is quick and easy.

## Unfinished Work
* Create fully functional buttons for the HomePage and Destination/Location Pages
* Create 360 videos of listed locations
* Link Videos to their respected page
* Publish App (Once everything is done)

## Completed Issues/User Stories
In this sprint report we decided on the format for our application. We are going to develop a mobile application in Dart
that will contain 360 videos for students to navigate campus. We each worked on pages for the application as follows: Martin Bui: Home page and directional buttons, Alex King: List of locations that can be batched with animations, Yurun Han: Connected previous two pages to pages containing info on the locations. 

In addition to our coding, we have started filming tours of the locations on campus. We have filmed the CUE, Cleveland Hall, and the CUB. We need to do a few other buildings still but are along the way with that. 

We took a survey of our users for what they would like to be featured in the app and we had responses that will shape the order in which we film. Theere are a few buildings that we thought would be more relevant than they are, and vice versa. 
 
## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
We need to make the transitions from pages more smooth and less clunky. I belive adding some transition animations will help this. We are
going to keep filming and meet with students to have them narrate a few of them as well. Some other issues we have are the locations. We need to be able to embed the videos into the application without making the app use too much memory.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
The updates we made for Sprint 2 were huge and effective.

* Changed technical support from swift to Flutter and Dart.
* The group members have fully learned Flutter, and firstly adapted to the application development of the Android platform.
* The team members made the basic pages of the app (home page, location list page, and destination/location page), and some jump buttons.
* The communication with customers has also received timely feedback, and I am satisfied with the current results and progress.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
* page art optimization
* UI UI optimization
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Add more information such as: video material and text material.
* Replace the unauthorized pictures with the background and information of the pictures taken by the team.
* Improve (info, location, more) page content after jump buttons.
* Add system tests.
* Add and refine other functional buttons and functions.
