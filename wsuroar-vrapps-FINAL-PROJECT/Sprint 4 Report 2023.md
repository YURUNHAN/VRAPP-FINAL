# Sprint 4 Report (5/2/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Complete final debugging.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
So far we have completed our planned revisions for features and customer feedback. Reviewing the goals and requirements of the App project, as well as the completed results are all good performance. From the completion of the project's functions and user feedback, etc., the project is successful. The technology and tools used in the App project, as well as the feasibility of the technical solution, are also in line with the customer's standards. Among them, the effectiveness of project management, including team communication, collaboration and progress control, has also been actively achieved through the efforts of the team.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
In short, we have achieved it in terms of project goals and results, user feedback, technical implementation and team project management. We also gained a lot of experience from the project. I think this is also the original intention of the school to arrange the project.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
Because this is the last sprint. I think we should summarize the successes and failures in the project, and put forward lessons and suggestions to improve the management and implementation of similar projects. So that we can make better progress in other projects in the future, and provide reference for future projects.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
