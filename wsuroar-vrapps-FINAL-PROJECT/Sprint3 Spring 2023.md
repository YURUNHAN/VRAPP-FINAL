# Sprint x Report (4/2/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
   * Create transit routes.
   * Track vehicles in real time using GTFS data.
   * Optimize the map function

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The main thing we did for this sprint was to provide some data support for our application. For example real-time bus routes. Since the Pullman Transit Office cannot provide us with a reliable Google Map Api Key, we can only use GTFS data to track vehicles in real time and make routes. In order to ensure the reliability of the technology, the team spent a lot of time and work to produce real-time positioning and routes of bus routes that support the map function. This sprint has also basically completed most of the functions of the application, and more details will be added later (such as UI beautification, user operations, etc.). And we also communicated ideas with customers. For the final purpose of the product, we are still working hard.
