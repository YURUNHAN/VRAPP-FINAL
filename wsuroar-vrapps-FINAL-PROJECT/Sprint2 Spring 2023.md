# Sprint x Report (2/2/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
   * Create maps with Google Maps Platform
   * Apply to create a Google Maps Api Key
   * Add map link to code
   * Optimize the map function

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The main work we do for this sprint is to have some deep main functionality for our app. Such as real-time maps, GPS or real-time bus routes. To keep the map usable, we spend a lot of time trying to add new features. Especially linking the map and getting the API took a lot of time. Customers agree with and support these ideas and processes. For the final purpose of the product, we are working hard.

## Unfinished Work
Features we are still finishing and refining:
* Movable map with location
* Allow users to select their current location and only serve them videos from specific destinations
* Implement 2FA for user login
* Added bus routes

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuroar-vrapps/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed
 We cleaned up the homepage and other various bugs.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 * （Because of some factors, such as the time to obtain the Api key. So the complete link graph code will be uploaded shortly.）
