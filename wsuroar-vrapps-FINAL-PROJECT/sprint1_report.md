# Sprint 1 Report ( 10/09/2022)


## What's New (User Facing)
* New 360-degree video specifications
   //Video time is limited
   //Update video content
* Optimized new user page design
* data collection
* Construction of the basic framework

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The first thing to understand is that this project is supported on both Android and iOS platforms. And in order to meet the special needs of subsequent further development and optimization, we have selected appropriate frameworks and languages. So, the current choices are Swift's switch syntax and Java. The first area to get comfortable with is running on iOS and Android, so we learned to develop Android apps and build frameworks using the Java all-in-one series. And at the same time, I learned Swift to meet the development of IOS and the mode of dual system. Avoid functional differences between Android and iOS products. We build on Android app development and then follow up on IOS. At present, the team is working hard to overcome the dual-system model and formula, and the team is selecting simple and excellent models. Therefore, we are looking for more effective and learnable modes based on the two hybrid APP development modes proposed before: "Native+H5" and "Native+Mini Programs". The reason for looking for more methods is that the cost of React Native's ideas and syntax will be relatively high and require a foundation.

## Unfinished Work
At present, the basic plans specified by the team are all within the controllable range and are being implemented normally. Completed the basic content required so far. If you must feedback some questions, it is that the specification and collection of 360-degree video is in progress, and some hardware equipment problems have been encountered, so it needs to be discussed and resolved with customers. All in all, the current progress and condition is good.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Cohesion within our group
* Relationship with client is very organized and communicative
* Collaboration on UI design ideas
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
